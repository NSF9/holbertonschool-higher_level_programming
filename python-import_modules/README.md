# 📦 Python - Import & Modules

This project demonstrates how to structure Python programs using modules and how to import functions from external Python files. It focuses on clean separation of logic, code reusability, and proper usage of the `import` statement along with best practices for script execution using `if __name__ == "__main__"`.
