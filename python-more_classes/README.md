# 📘 Python - More Classes and Objects

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.  
It dives deeper into object-oriented programming in Python, focusing on class structure, object instantiation, method definitions, encapsulation, and Pythonic approaches to data handling.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python.
- Explain Python’s philosophy of "**first-class everything**".
- Differentiate between:
  - **Class vs Object (Instance)**
  - **Class Attribute vs Instance Attribute**
  - **Attribute vs Property**
- Define and use:
  - `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`
  - Public, protected, and private attributes
  - Properties with `@property`, setters
  - Class methods using `@classmethod`
  - Static methods using `@staticmethod`
- Create dynamic attributes for objects and classes.
- Explore object internals using `__dict__`.
- Use Python built-ins like `getattr()` to access attributes safely.
